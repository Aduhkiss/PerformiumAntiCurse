# Performium Anti-Curse

This plugin is a plugin to stop at least 90% of swear words on any Minecraft server

When a person trys to send a message with bad language, the plugin picks up on it and will stop the message from being sent, and will mute the player for 1 Hour (can be changed in the source code).

This plugin was written by me, TheBeefSteak (angusbeefsteak), for the Performium Network Minecraft servers.
